# DLL-FruitNinjaGame
Implementation of a variation of the game "Fruit Ninja" using mBed and DLL.

This code is code for the mBed compiler. It implements the "Fruit Ninja" game where it changes positions with the accelerometer. As well it uses a Doubly-LinkedList to keep track of the bombs, fruit, and number of knives on the screen.e

This project does not have the mBed files. They can be found on the mBed website.
